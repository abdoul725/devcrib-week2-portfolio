Pixel Forge: Portfolio Clone
This repository contains the solution for the DevCrib Week 2, Task 1: Portfolio Clone (Pixel Forge) challenge. The goal was to clone a portfolio layout using only raw HTML and CSS (Flexbox and Grid) to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy and full responsiveness.

✨ Project Overview
This project is a static, multi-section portfolio website built strictly without frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap, focusing on core styling techniques to replicate a given design reference.

The layout includes all required sections:

Header: Fixed navigation with a logo and links.

Hero Section: Full-screen intro with a gradient background and a modern card style.

About Section: Detailed description and a skills section leveraging Flexbox for layout.

Projects Section: (A placeholder section utilizing CSS Grid for the layout, as per the challenge requirement).

Footer: Contact information and social media links.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 (Semantic Structure)

CSS3 (Styling)

CSS Variables (:root): Used extensively for colors, spacing, fonts, shadows, and transitions, ensuring maintainability and clean code.

Flexbox: Used for component-level alignment in the Header, Hero, About content, and Footer sections.

CSS Grid: Used for complex, multi-column layouts, specifically in the Skills Grid and for structuring the Projects layout.

Media Queries: Implemented at breakpoints of 992px, 768px, and 480px to ensure full responsiveness across all devices.

🎯 Implementation Highlights (Meeting Challenge Requirements)
Layout: All required sections (Header, Hero, About, Projects, Footer) are present and correctly structured.

Raw CSS: Pure, vanilla CSS was used exclusively.

Responsiveness: Media queries fluidly restructure key areas, such as stacking the About content and adapting the column count of the skills and project grids for mobile views.

Git Workflow: All project changes were managed via the Command Line Interface (CLI), ensuring adherence to the required conventional commit structure (feat:, fix:, style:) on the designated task-1 branch.
